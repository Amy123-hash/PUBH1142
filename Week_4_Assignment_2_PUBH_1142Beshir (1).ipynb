        "###1. What is the difference between a spreadsheet and a database?\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets) are tools designed for organizing and analyzing data in a flat, tabular format using rows and columns. They are suitable for small datasets, allowing users to perform basic calculations, sorting, filtering, and visualization using built-in tools.\n",
        "*  Databases (Microsoft SQL Server) are designed to handle large and complex datasets efficiently. They store data in multiple structured tables with defined relationships, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and multi-user access. Unlike spreadsheets, databases enforce data normalization to reduce redundancy and maintain consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a spreadsheet for health data management?\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Advantages:\n",
        "  *   User-friendly interface – Easy to use for individuals with minimal technical knowledge.\n",
        "  *  Simple data entry and formatting – Allows manual data input and customization with formatting options.\n",
        "  *   Basic data analysis and visualization – Provides built-in functions for calculations, creating charts, and summarizing data using pivot tables.\n",
        "  *   Flexibility – Can be used for quick, small-scale data manipulation and reporting.\n",
        "  *   Compatibility – Can be exported to other formats (e.g., CSV, XLSX) for further analysis in software like R or Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Disadvantages:\n",
        "  *   Limited scalability – Not ideal for handling large datasets, as performance may degrade with increased data volume.\n",
        "  *   Data integrity issues – No built-in mechanisms to prevent duplicate or inconsistent data entry.\n",
        "  *   Lack of multi-user access – Difficult for multiple users to edit simultaneously without conflicts.\n",
        "  *   Security limitations – Basic protection options, but lacks robust access controls like user authentication and encryption.\n",
        "  *   Error-prone – Manual data entry increases the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies.\n",
